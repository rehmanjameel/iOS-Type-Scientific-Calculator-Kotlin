## Unique Features
* Uses 
  * Complete Implementation of simple and scientfic operations without using any third party library.
  * All functions performed by using built math operations (Kotlin.math)
  * Finding this tool was a big relief because it uses BigDecimal precision.
  * A big hand of [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-make-a-scientific-calculator-android-app-using-android-studio/) in helping to give the idea of functionalities
  * Calculations based on text input.  Uses [Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation).
  * Unicode reference for special characters [Uni codes wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Unicode_characters)
* Has two different layouts for portrait and landscape.  I had a hard time finding code examples on the internet that had both these features
* Attempting to include unit testing because it was very difficult to find good articles explaining how to do these.  **(still in development)**
